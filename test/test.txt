Hello There General You fool! I have been trained in the Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship. 

OBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku! 

OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies. 

OBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed. 

OBI-WAN: I don't think so. 

TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him. 

113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY 

More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS. 
The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.

114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY 

The chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga. 

115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET

The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red. 

116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET 

PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE. 

PALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate. 

PADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution? 

PALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . . 

PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then. 

PALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here. 

FANGZAR: But surely . . . 

The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR. 

PALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee. 

PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor. 

PALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator. 

PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN. 

PALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us. 

ANAKIN: What do you mean? 

PALPATINE: They are not to be trusted. 

ANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . . 

PALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes. 

ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken. 

PALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things. 

ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala. 

PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look. 

PALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin. 

117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING 

KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms. 

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we 
have begun our attack. 

MACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his 
intentions. 

ANAKIN: Yes, Master. 

ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.
